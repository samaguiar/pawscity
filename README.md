This is my Code Louisville Project!

This is my website for PawCity Animal Company. 

I have used two media queries to have mobile, tablet, and desktop views. 

I have included to use Flexbox to reorangize content on the page. For example, the Animal Titles section goes from a one column grid on the mobile view to a 3 row, 2 column grid on tablet and desktop. The Top Recommendation section has a similar use of Flexbox to go from a 1 column grid to a 2x2 grid. 

I have also reorganized the About Doggo section. This goes from
a 1 column grid on mobile and tablet to a 2 column grid on desktop. This is the same style and use of media queries for the About Paws City section. 

The naviation/hamburger button will hide when moving to a desktop view using media queries (located under the header). The hamburger button uses Java Script to open/close on click for mobile and desktop verisons.
